    <p class="mb-4">Getting started is simple. You’ll be making one set of impressions: top and bottom. Each one takes 3 ½ minutes to complete.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Start by making a top impression, checking it to be sure it came out just right. If anything seems off, you can correct it by removing the putty after the impression sets and give it another go!</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Pull out the containers of putty. Make sure to leave them out so they reach room temperature before you begin.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">To make the mold, put your gloves on and mix the white putty with the blue putty until they are one solid color. </p>
    <p class="mb-4">Once you begin mixing you have to work fast, then immediately place the mold in your mouth</p>
    <p class="mb-4">The putty mixture will set in 60 seconds.</p>
    <p>Blend the white and blue putties together until they form one color with no visible swirls.</p>
