    <p>Sensitivity (and sometimes downright pain) has been by far the most common negative side effect of teeth whitening â€“ including both at-home and in-office whitening.</p>
    <p>The potential discomfort associated with teeth whitening is the top reason we hear why individuals refrain from or discontinue their whitening treatment.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to educate our customers and explain the science behind what is happening when you whiten your teeth.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s important to explain the anatomy of a tooth to properly understand how teeth can change color and with that, potentially experience sensitivity.</p>

      <div class="mt-4">Teeth are porous, similar to our skin. The pores of the enamel are connected to the dentin where dentinal tubules are. Dentinal tubules are tiny tubules that run from the inside of the tooth (the pulp chamber) out through the hard dentin and end beneath the enamel.</div>

        <p class="mb-4">Dentinal tubules are unique to each person, they vary in shape and size. This is mostly due to genetics and diet, it is a fact that having a more acidic diet decomposes smear plugs and enlarges the inner diameter of the dentinal tubule.</p>
        <p>Ideally, dentinal tubules have naturally-formed smear plugs blocking or plugging the entrance to the tubules, when dentinal tubule smear plugs are lost it results in potential for dental sensitivity.</p>
