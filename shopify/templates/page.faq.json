          "settings": {
            "question": "How Does Teeth Whitening Work?",
            "answer": "<p>Teeth whitening is the removal of stains and discolorations from the enamel and dentin. The outer layer of the tooth is enamel, and beneath the enamel is dentin. Enamel is thin and typically clear in color, while dentin is darker in color and makes up the bulk of the tooth. Enamel can get discolored over time simply from age, but also from outside sources like coffee, tea, tobacco, and other foods and beverages rich in color.<\/p><p><br\/>Whitening your teeth removes these stains and discolorations, giving you a bright white bite. The active ingredients in Lumos Smile teeth whitening gels pass into your teeth to oxidize the stained molecules deep down in your teeth, removing stains and whitening your smile. Our formula is sticky and viscous, so it stays where it’s placed. This unique feature prevents the teeth whitening gel from seeping out during treatment, ensuring both the gel and tray stay in place and work effectively for the duration of your treatment.<\/p>"

            "question": "What Causes Teeth Sensitivity?",
            "answer": "<p>Tooth sensitivity is a relatively common side effect of teeth whitening. No harm is caused to your tooth as a result of a whitening treatment, and this discomfort is not an indication of damage to your tooth. If sensitivity occurs, it is most often temporary and will go away when you&rsquo;ve completed the whitening process. We included desensitizing gel with every purchase just in case you do experience tooth sensitivity.<\/p>"

We should receive your package within 3-4 business days and our dental lab will then create your custom-fit whitening trays.
